# Developing a Lead Scoring Model for Term Deposit Subscription in a Telemarketing Campaign

## Context

The dataset utilized in this project is the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset features a Portuguese bank that offers term deposits as a financial product to its existing customers. The bank is currently running a telemarketing campaign targeting these customers through both inbound and outbound calls to promote the term deposit product. The success of this campaign is overseen by the director of marketing, who is responsible for making strategic decisions to optimize the campaign's effectiveness.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a lead scoring model that enhances the bankâ€™s telemarketing efforts by predicting which customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. 

Key objectives include:

- **Developing a Lead Scoring System:** Create a model that ranks customers based on their predicted probability of subscribing to a term deposit.
- **Identifying High-Potential Leads:** Improve targeting efficiency in the telemarketing campaign by focusing on leads with the highest probability of conversion.
- **Providing Actionable Insights:** Offer recommendations for better resource allocation (e.g., funds) and enhanced campaign strategies to the marketing director.

## Vision

We propose to create a predictive lead scoring model that ranks customers based on their likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. By concentrating efforts on the most promising leads, this model aims to:

- **Optimize the Telemarketing Campaign:** Increase the overall effectiveness of the campaign.
- **Improve Return on Investment:** Enhance the bank's ROI by effectively allocating resources and targeting high-potential leads.
